# README_Generator

## Description

This project uses the command line interface to generate a README file from prompts that are answered by the user. THe project auto populates a template file with the user responses, including a license badge and link. .

- My motivation for creating this project was to easily generate proffesional README files for my projects.
- The problem I am trying to solve is that it takes too much time to make README files from scratch and don't contribute much to the learning process for coding.

## Installation

The steps you need to take to install this project are to fork the github repo and clone the project to your local machine. Then use node to inititalize the code in the command line..

## Usage

All you have to do to use this application is initialize it through the command line and then answer the question prompts. I used this code to generate this README.md... mostly.
